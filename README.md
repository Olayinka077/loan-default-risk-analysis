# 💳 Loan Default Risk Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **loan default risk** by examining customer demographic and financial data to identify factors that contribute to loan repayment failure. The goal is to support **risk assessment and data-driven lending decisions** by uncovering patterns, trends, and key risk indicators.

## Business Problem
Financial institutions face significant losses due to loan defaults. Poor risk assessment can lead to:
- Increased non-performing loans  
- Reduced profitability  
- Inefficient credit allocation  

This project aims to answer:
- What factors influence loan default?
- Which customer segments are high risk?
- How can insights improve lending decisions?

---

##  Dataset Description
The dataset contains **customer and loan-related information**, including:
- Demographic details (age, employment status, income)
- Credit history
- Loan amount and duration
- Loan status (default / non-default)

### Data Preparation
- Removed duplicates and irrelevant fields  
- Handled missing values  
- Standardized data types  
- Created derived metrics for analysis  

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Data Analysis:** SQL, Excel  
- **Business Intelligence:** Power BI  
- **Analytics Techniques:**  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
  - Risk Analysis  
  - Trend Analysis  
  - KPI Measurement  

---

## Methodology
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Exploratory analysis to understand distribution and trends  
3. Identification of high-risk customer profiles  
4. Visualization of default patterns using interactive dashboards  
5. Interpretation of insights for business decision-making  

---

## Key Insights
- Customers with **low income and poor credit history** showed a higher likelihood of default  
- Certain loan tenures were associated with increased default rates  
- Employment status played a significant role in repayment behavior  
- Default risk increased with higher debt-to-income ratios  

---

## Dashboard & Visualizations
The Power BI dashboard includes:
- Default vs non-default distribution  
- Risk segmentation by income, age, and loan amount  
- Key performance indicators (KPIs) for loan performance  
- Interactive filters for deeper analysis

## Recommendations
- Strengthen credit checks for high-risk customer segments  
- Adjust loan terms for customers with higher default probability  
- Use data-driven risk scoring to support approval decisions  
- Continuously monitor loan performance using dashboards  

---

## Conclusion
This analysis demonstrates how **data analytics and visualization** can improve loan risk assessment. By identifying high-risk patterns early, financial institutions can reduce losses and make more informed lending decisions.
